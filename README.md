Basic Image Classifier using SAP Leonardo ML API

Test app to use SAP's Leanoardo Machine Learning API from https://api.sap.com. There seems to be no documentation on how this machine learning model was trained. Its incapable of detecting people - just simple everyday objects.
There is also the 'product image classification' service, which SAP claims is better for classifying business/office type images like computer, printer, etc.

Both of them are pretty poor in comparison to the Microsoft and Google cloud-based ML image classification services.
